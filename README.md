# Example app with Sprockets plugin

This is an example app for showing how easy it is to write an Sprockets plugin. More in this [blog post](http://masa331.github.io/2017/01/10/writing_sprockets_plugin.html).

Note that you have to have [Elm compiler](http://elm-lang.org/) installed on your system in order for this to run.
